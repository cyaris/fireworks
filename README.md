# fireworks

Svelte package and demo app for rendering animated fireworks. It exposes reusable Svelte components and JavaScript functions that other local projects can use for celebratory UI moments.

## Live usage

The fireworks can be viewed live on <a href="https://charlieyaris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charlieyaris.com</a> by clicking the fireworks button on the top left of the navigation bar. They are also incorporated into the <a href="https://github.com/cyaris/profile_photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profile photo</a> on the <a href="https://charlieyaris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home page</a> and into <a href="https://github.com/cyaris/mastermind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastermind</a>, which can be played on the <a href="https://charlieyaris.com/mastermind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project page</a>.

## What it does

- Renders a full-window SVG fireworks canvas.
- Launches randomized firework bursts using D3 transitions, timers, easing, and color palettes.
- Provides a `FireworkShow` component that starts a configurable main show and finale.
- Exports both component and function entry points for use in other Svelte apps.

## Development

Install dependencies from this directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the local Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build and package:

```sh
npm run build
npm run rollup
```

Run validation:

```sh
npm run check
npm run lint
npm run format:check
```

## Embedded Bundle Deployment

The `Rollup upload` GitHub Actions workflow builds the rollup bundles and uploads them to
`s3://cyaris.github.io/fireworks/`. This project uploads both `bundle.*` and `bundle2.*` artifacts.

Manual dispatch uploads staged `test_bundle.*` files by default. Set `production` during manual dispatch to upload live
`bundle.*` files instead. Pushes to `main` or `master`, including merges into those branches, always run with production
upload names and `dry-run` disabled.

Set the repository variable `SVELTE_LIB_REF` to control which `svelte-lib` branch, tag, or SHA the automatic production
workflow checks out for both the local file dependency and the shared rollup upload action. Manual dispatch exposes the
same value as the `svelte-lib-ref` input.

The workflow checks out the private `svelte-lib` repository and runs `.github/actions/rollup-upload` from that checkout.
Provide `CHECKOUT_TOKEN` with read access to `svelte-lib` and any private local dependency repositories. AWS
authentication uses `AWS_ROLLUP_UPLOAD_ROLE_ARN` when present, otherwise it expects AWS access-key secrets.

## Local usage

Projects in this workspace use the package through a local file dependency, for example:

```json
"fireworks": "file:../fireworks"
```

Import the Svelte component when an app needs a ready-made show:

```svelte
<script>
  import { FireworkShow } from "fireworks/components"
</script>

<div class="fixed left-0 top-0">
  <FireworkShow totalFireworksMain={75} totalFireworksFinale={25} />
</div>
```

The lower-level functions are also available from `fireworks/functions`.

## Credits

The firework burst process is adapted from this D3 blocks example:

This package keeps the core idea while expanding and improving on it, with adjustments for local preferences and package-version differences.
